# Kauthie

Kauthie is a account/user managment implementation so I don't ever have to write that again.

I implemented this all login/logout/reset/invite/edit thing a few times and I am getting tiered of it,
I looked at *UserApp* and *StormPath* but I never was stoked @ outsourcing or depending on someone else
for a core part of an app.

This implementation is written on Go with the Gin framework and exposes a simple JSON API to allow other
parts of the app to interact with account data. OAuth2 is also implemented.
